Don't worry its completety normal that you feel afraid or frustated by the fact that you cant leave your home. It will all be over soon. Social distancing has completey changed they way in which we carry out our daily life. Not being able to go out and meet your friends or see family can be very difficult for one to handle. They may not be used to being alone, they may crave the affection of another individuals presence, They may be thinking that they have nothing to do whilst lockedown.</p><p><strong><em>BY ELLI GREYSTONE</em></strong></p></div>

                <strong> M</strong>onday morning around 8am, i find myself pasting up and down, walking around the front room, almost as if i were waiting to hear something new, something positive. I promised myself that i would be productive today, i just dont know how, i dont even know where to start?. Im looking outside the white frayed blinds wondering whats happening out there? I feel like im in a prison looking outside my cell, waiting for my time to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>The government set out guidlines for the public to follow to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They belive that if we stay home and socially disatnce ourselves from every and anybody, that it will reduce that amount of outbreaks. Staying at home and having nothing to do is slowly making me feel mad. I am restless at night, when i do finally get to go sleep i wake up at 7pm in the afternoon or worst case scenario, i wake up too early and have nothing to do. Im struggling to maintain my sanity, something i took for granted taken away from me in a matter of days. Its day 15 for me, ive been locked up in my house with my sister and mother. It was fine the few days, everybody was getting along just fine. We were excited to finally be around eachother and sppend some good quality time with eachother. We played bored games, had dance offs, binge watched netflix shows and we evern had a pillow fight. It was all fun and games until we started to get annoyed at eachother. I felt like i was around my family too much, everything they did was frustrating me. Everything they did was making me want to leave the house more and more. Here's the worst thing, its not even their fault, they have done nothing wrong, not one thing. It was me that was the problem, i didnt want to be aound them, i wanted to do my own thing, pack my lunch and go off to work like i usually did, but unfortunately i couldnt. I cant.</p><p>I personally have never had something impact my life so much. This virus has changed society and the way in which we now funcion and respond to a crisis. This COVID-19 can be overcome if we work together as a worldwide community. Social distancing, staying at home, working from home and following the governtments guidlines is what's going to save us. The fact that people are not taking this virus seriously and leaving their homes to go meet friends and family is frightening to me. Its caused me to become very worried about my future, i have developed extreme anxiety. I am so frightened of what tis virus is going to do to me. I am not the most healthy person, my immune system is weak. If i somehow contract the virus its over for me, my body is not strong enough to cope with something so serious. COVID-19 breaks down your body's immune sytem and causes mucus to build up around your body's tissue, which then compromises an individuals ability to inhale and exhale. This is frightening to me, i dont want that to happen to my body. I dont desrve that, nobody does.</p><p>There are thousand of people who are loving the results of the coronavirus. They are tweeting and snapping " I'm loving self-isolation, it's the best thing thats ever happened to me". This fustrates me, because it makes me wonder why? why are people loving the fact that they have to stay home, with nothing to do? i believe that there will be a point where one will just have enough. There are thousands of inmates in prison who have commited suicide due to being confined in a cell for more than half of thier day. One can only imagine what that is like. having to sit thier for hours and hours thinking about the horrible things they have done in laugh must be taunting. I believe that one has to have great control over their emotions and very strong mentally to be in prison. This is all becuase of COVID-19, i feel like im locked up, with nowhere to go and no way to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm trapped in my head not my home, being at home is completely fine, there are a number of people who work from home everyday. They run a business, make sure that everything gets done with no complictaions. They are completely fine during this unsettling time. However, you have individuals such as muself who are completely incapable of sitting still and being home. I'm so used to going out and doing what i want, when i want, that this virus has made me ill. Im trapped in my own head and its completely frustrating. I dont know what i'm doing anymore, i promise i had a plan, but i just dont know anymore. The government have said that we are allowed 1 form of exercise a day, we are only allowed to leave our home to shop for our groceries. If we dont follow the guidlines we can be fined or jailed. This is a scary time, i wont be surprised if i found out people are leaving thier house more than they should. I want too as well. This is hell to me and it's making me feel like i need to seek help. Do i need a therapist or am i going through what everybody else is going though?</p><p>Due to fear i am isolating myself from the people in my home, the ones who are trying to help and look after me during this crazy time. I seem to be pushing way the only people who are realy going to support me suring this caos. As a wise person once said " keep calm and carry on". I plan to do so, i need to make myself mentally stronger, i need to focus and build realtionships with my loved ones to get over this and come out stronger. &nbsp;We all need to keep calm and carry on, working together and focusing on our wellbing and focusing on the saftey of others will help us overcome this outbreak. We will come out strongner and more fierce.</p></div>
